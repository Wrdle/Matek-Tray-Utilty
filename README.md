# Matek Tray Utilty
This is just a program I wrote in my spare time to increase my own productivity. I was getting annoyed that I had to keep entering in ip addresses when rdp'ing into servers and I dont like filling up my desktop with items so this was my solutions. 

# Instructions
The program will automatically create a program if not already created in your documents called "Matek Tray Utility". In this folder just create a new folder and start dragging shortcuts in. To seperate items in the list sort them into their sections by creating new folders and placing the shortcuts in such folders.
